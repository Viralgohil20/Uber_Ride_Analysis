#Uber_Ride_Analysis 🚗💸💻

#Introduction 📝

This project analyzes the dataset of Uber and Lyft for Boston during November and December to predict the price, which is the target variable. The goal of the project is to build a model that accurately predicts the price based on various factors such as distance, time of day, and weather conditions.

#Who can benefit? 🤔

The project can be beneficial for those who are interested in the transportation industry and want to understand the factors that affect the pricing of ride-sharing services. By analyzing the data, the project can provide insights into the pricing strategy of Uber and Lyft and how it varies based on different factors. The model developed in the project can also help ride-sharing companies to predict prices accurately, which can lead to better decision-making.

#Why data analysis? 🤔📊

Data analysis is crucial for this project as it involves analyzing a large dataset containing various factors that influence the price of ride-sharing services. By analyzing the data, we can identify patterns and relationships between different variables, which can help predict the price accurately. Additionally, data analysis can help in identifying outliers and anomalies in the dataset that can affect the accuracy of the model.

#How to improve decision making? 🤔💡

By analyzing the Uber and Lyft data for Boston during November and December and predicting the price, the project can provide valuable insights to the stakeholders. For example, it can help ride-hailing companies optimize their pricing strategies based on the demand patterns observed during these months. It can also help the customers to make informed decisions about when to take a ride, based on the predicted price. Additionally, the analysis can identify any gaps in the market, such as underserved areas or times with high demand and low supply, which can help policymakers to make data-driven decisions to address these issues. Overall, the insights gained from the analysis can lead to more efficient and effective decision-making in the ride-hailing industry.

#Data 📊

Based on the provided data, it seems that this is a dataset related to ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. The data contains 693,071 rows and 57 columns. The columns include various attributes related to each ride such as the ride ID, timestamp, hour, day, month, and time zone, as well as the source and destination locations, the type of ride service (e.g., Lyft, Uber), and the product ID (e.g., Lyft Line, Lux Black XL). Other columns include information about the type of vehicle used, the driver's rating, the distance of the trip, the price, weather related data, and other relevant information. Overall, it seems like this data could be useful for analyzing ride-hailing services, such as identifying patterns in ride usage, exploring the factors that affect pricing, or understanding the demographics of riders.

#Source 📌

The dataset used in this study was sourced from Kaggle and pertains to the comparison between the ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft. Despite containing a significant number of missing values, the dataset offers an excellent opportunity for beginners to explore the relationship between various predictors such as the hour of the day and the corresponding price. Notably, the dataset also includes information on the weather conditions during each hour, including temperature, wind, and sunset, which are critical factors influencing ride-hailing demand. This additional data presents an opportunity to incorporate external factors into the analysis of the two ride-hailing services.

#Variables 📈

There are 57 variables in dataset consisting of 46 numeric and 11 categorical variables. Out of the original 57 variables, several have been removed during the data cleaning and transformation stage. These include "Id" which was only used for unique records, "Datetime" and "Timestamp" as month, day, and hour were already available, and "Timezone" which was only one time zone. "Product_id"
